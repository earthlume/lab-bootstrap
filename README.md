# lab-bootstrap

Universal CLI bootstrapper for [lab.hoens.fun](https://lab.hoens.fun) — one command to set up a consistent, polished shell environment across every node in the fleet.

## Quick Start

On a freshly flashed Debian-based host where user `lume` exists:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earthlume/lab-bootstrap/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

Then start a new shell:

```bash
exec zsh
```

That's it. Safe to re-run at any time.

## What It Does

Sets up a modern CLI environment — ZSH with plugins, Starship prompt, and a curated set of tools that replace the crusty defaults. This is **general-purpose shell setup only** — no Docker, no application services, no role-specific software.

### Packages (via apt)

`bat` `ripgrep` `fd-find` `fzf` `tealdeer` `duf` `btop` `tmux` `neovim` `ncdu` `jq` `tree` and more

### Prebuilt Binaries (architecture-aware)

| Tool | Purpose | x86_64 | aarch64 | armhf v7 (Pi 3) | armhf v6 (Pi Zero) |
|------|---------|:------:|:-------:|:----------------:|:------------------:|
| [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) | Modern `ls` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) | Smart `cd` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) | Git pager | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| [dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust) | Disk usage | ✅ | ✅ | — | ❌ |

### Shell Setup

- **ZSH** as default shell with [Antidote](https://github.com/mattmc3/antidote) plugin manager
- **Plugins:** autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, history substring search, sudo (double-ESC), alias reminders
- **[Starship](https://starship.rs)** prompt with teal accent — shows hostname (SSH only), directory, git, command duration
- **Aliases** that map old commands to modern replacements (`ls`→`eza`, `cat`→`bat`, `grep`→`rg`, `find`→`fd`)
- **fzf** keybindings (Ctrl-R for history, Ctrl-T for files)

### System Config

- **SSH:** ed25519 keypair generated (displayed at end for GitHub setup)
- **Git:** identity configured (`earthlume`), delta as pager with side-by-side diffs
- **MOTD:** branded login banner with live system info (hostname, OS, uptime, IP, CPU, memory, disk)

## Architecture & Platform Support

The bootstrapper auto-detects CPU architecture (including ARM sub-version via `/proc/cpuinfo`) and available RAM. ARMv6 devices like the Pi Zero and Pi 1 are first-class targets with a gracefully reduced feature set.

### Compatibility Matrix

| Feature | x86_64 | aarch64 (Pi 4/5) | armhf v7 (Pi 3) | armhf v6 (Pi Zero/1) |
|---------|:------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------:|
| Apt tools (bat, rg, fd, fzf, btop, duf) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| GitHub binaries (eza, zoxide, delta) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| dust | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Starship prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (fallback) |
| ZSH + Antidote plugins | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### ARMv6 Behavior (Pi Zero / Pi 1)

On ARMv6 devices, the bootstrapper automatically:

- **Skips all GitHub-hosted binaries** — the `armhf` builds published on GitHub target ARMv7 minimum and will not execute on ARMv6
- **Skips Starship** — no ARMv6 build exists. A **pure Zsh fallback prompt** is deployed instead, with teal accents, `vcs_info` git branch display, and SSH-only hostname — same look, zero dependencies
- **Guards aliases** — `ls`→`eza` and `du`→`dust` aliases are wrapped in `command -v` checks so they silently degrade to system defaults when the tools aren't present

All apt-installed tools (bat, ripgrep, fd, fzf, btop, duf, tealdeer) work on ARMv6.

### Low RAM Detection (≤512 MB)

The bootstrapper detects total system RAM from `/proc/meminfo` and sets an `IS_LOW_RAM` flag when the device has 512 MB or less. A warning is emitted at startup for operator visibility.

### Tested Platforms

| Architecture | OS | Example Hosts |
|-------------|-----|---------------|
| x86_64 | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS | Workstations, VMs |
| aarch64 | Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm) | Pi 4, Pi 5 |
| armhf v7 | Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm) | Pi 3 |
| armhf v6 | Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm) | Pi Zero, Pi 1 |

## Module Order

| # | Module | What It Does |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 01 | packages | `apt update` + install base packages and modern CLI tools |
| 02 | binaries | Download eza, zoxide, delta, dust from GitHub releases (skipped on ARMv6) |
| 03 | zsh | Install Antidote, deploy plugins, `chsh` to zsh |
| 04 | starship | Install Starship + config, or deploy fallback prompt on ARMv6 |
| 05 | shell-config | Deploy `.zshrc`, aliases, create `bat`/`fd` symlinks |
| 06 | ssh | Generate ed25519 keypair, configure git identity + delta |
| 07 | motd | Deploy branded MOTD with live system stats (OS-aware strategy) |
| 08 | cleanup | `apt autoremove`, print summary, show SSH pubkey |

## Repo Structure

```
lab-bootstrap/
├── bootstrap.sh          # curl target — installs git, clones repo, runs main.sh
├── main.sh               # sources lib/, runs modules in order
├── modules/              # numbered modules, executed sequentially
├── templates/            # config files deployed to the system
│   ├── prompt-fallback.zsh   # pure Zsh prompt for ARMv6 (no Starship)
│   └── ...
├── lib/                  # shared functions (logging, detection, helpers)
├── LICENSE               # MIT
└── README.md
```

## Per-Host Customization

Drop a `~/.zshrc.local` file for host-specific overrides (env vars, project aliases, etc.). It's sourced at the end of `.zshrc` and is not managed by the bootstrap.

## What This Does NOT Do

- Install role-specific software (Ollama, HAILO, Docker, Home Assistant)
- Configure networking, DNS, or firewall
- Set hostname or create users
- Manage systemd services
- Install Nerd Fonts (install those on your SSH client, not the server)
